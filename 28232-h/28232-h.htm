<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p><span class="scap">This</span> play&mdash;originally intended to form part of
<i>Angels and Ministers</i>&mdash;was separated on an after-thought
as a concession to those who do not like to
have their politics and their religion mixed. And,
as the Victorian age was eminently successful in
keeping the two apart, it is 'in keeping,' in another
sense, with the Victorianism of the religion here
portrayed that it should make its appearance under a
separate cover.</p>

<p>As some of my critics seem anxious to trace the inspiration
of these Victorian plays to an outside source,
and are divided, as regards the historical section,
between the <i>Abraham Lincoln</i> of Mr. John Drinkwater
and the <i>Queen Victoria</i> of Mr. Lytton Strachey,
may I assure them that my historical method of
treating Kings and Queens 'intimately' was derived
from my own play <i>Pains and Penalties</i>, published
in 1911, and that my anthropomorphic theology is
based upon the first book I ever wrote, <i>Gods and their
Makers</i>, published in 1897. I do not think that
<i>Possession</i> owes anything either to <i>Cranford</i> or the
writings of Mrs. Humphry Ward.</p>

<h2><a name="Possession" id="Possession"></a>Possession</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>The Everlasting Habitations</i></p>

<p><i>It is evening (or so it seems), and to the comfortably
furnished Victorian drawing-room a middle-aged
maid-servant in cap and apron brings a lamp, and
proceeds to draw blinds and close curtains. To do
this she passes the fire-place, where before a
pleasantly bright hearth sits, comfortably sedate,
an elderly lady whose countenance and attitude
suggest the very acme of genteel repose. She is a
handsome woman, very conscious of herself, but
carrying the burden of her importance with an ease
which, in her own mind, leaves nothing to be
desired. The once-striking outline of her features
has been rounded by good feeding to a softness
which is merely physical; and her voice, when she
speaks, has a calculated gentleness very caressing
to her own ear, and a little irritating to others who
are not of an inferior class. Menials like it, however.
The room, though over-upholstered, and not
furnished with any more individual taste than that
which gave its generic stamp to the great Victorian
period, is the happy possessor of some good things.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[<a href="./images/12.png">12</a>]</span>
<i>Upon the mantel-shelf, backed by a large mirror,
stands old china in alternation with alabaster jars,
under domed shades, and tall vases encompassed
by pendant ringlets of glass-lustre. Rose-wood,
walnut, and mahogany make a well-wooded interior;
and in the dates thus indicated there is a touch of
Georgian. But, over and above these mellowing
features of a respectable ancestry, the annunciating
Angel of the Great Exhibition of 1851 has spread
a brooding wing. And while the older articles are
treasured on account of family association, the
younger and newer stand erected in places of honour
by reason of an intrinsic beauty never previously
attained to. Through this chamber the dashing
crinoline has wheeled the too vast orb of its fate,
and left fifty years after (if we may measure the
times of Heaven by the ticks of an earthly chronometer)
a mark which nothing is likely to erase.
Upon the small table, where Hannah the servant
deposits the lamp, lies a piece of crochet-work.
The fair hands that have been employed on it are
folded on a lap of corded silk representing the
fashions of the nineties, and the grey-haired beauty
(that once was) sits contemplative, wearing a cap of
creamish lace, tastefully arranged, not unaware
that in the entering lamp-light, and under the fire's
soft glow of approval, she presents to her domestic's
eye an improving picture of gentility. It is to
Miss Julia Robinson's credit&mdash;and she herself
places it there emphatically&mdash;that she always treats</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[<a href="./images/13.png">13</a>]</span>
<i>servants humanly, though at a distance. And
when she now speaks she confers her slight remark
just a little as though it were a favour.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> How the days are drawing out, Hannah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hannah.</span> Yes, Ma'am; nicely, aren't they?</p>

<p>(<i>For Hannah, being old-established, may say
a thing or two not in the strict order. In
fact, it may be said that, up to a well-understood
point, character is encouraged
in her, and is allowed to peep through in
her remarks.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> What time is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hannah</span> (<i>looking with better eyes than her mistress
at the large ormolu clock which records eternally the time
of the great Exhibition</i>). Almost a quarter to six,
Ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> So late? She ought to have been here
long ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hannah.</span> Who, Ma'am, did you say, Ma'am?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> My sister, Mrs. James. You remember?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hannah.</span> What, Miss Martha, Ma'am? Well!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> No, it's Miss Laura this time: you didn't
know she had married, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hannah</span> (<i>with a world of meaning, well under control</i>).
No, Ma'am. (<i>A pause.</i>) I made up the bed in the
red room; was that right, Ma'am?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>archly surprised</i>). What? Then you knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[<a href="./images/14.png">14</a>]</span>
someone was coming? Why did you pretend,
Hannah?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hannah.</span> Well, Ma'am, you see, you hadn't <i>told</i>
me before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I couldn't. One cannot always be sure.
(<i>This mysteriously.</i>) But something tells me now that
she is to be with us. I have been expecting her over
four days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hannah</span> (<i>picking her phrases a little, as though on
doubtful ground</i>). It must be a long way, Ma'am. Did
she make a comfortable start, Ma'am?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Very quietly, I'm told. No pain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hannah.</span> I wonder what she'll be able to eat now,
Ma'am. She was always very particular.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I daresay you will be told soon enough.
(<i>Thus in veiled words she conveys that Hannah knows
something of Mrs. James's character.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hannah</span> (<i>resignedly</i>). Yes, M'm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I don't think I'll wait any longer. If you'll
bring in tea now. Make enough for two, in case:
pour it off into another pot, and have it under the
tea-cosy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hannah.</span> Yes, Ma'am.</p>

<p>(<i>Left alone, the dear lady enjoys the sense of
herself and the small world of her own
thoughts in solitude. Then she sighs
indulgently.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[<a href="./images/15.png">15</a>]</span><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Yes, I suppose I would rather it had been
Martha. Poor Laura! (<i>She puts out her hand for her
crochet, when it is arrested by the sound of a knock, rather
rapacious in character.</i>) Ah, that's Laura all over!</p>

<p>(<i>Seated quite composedly and fondling her
well-kept hands, she awaits the moment
of arrival. Very soon the door opens,
and the over-expected Mrs. James&mdash;a
luxuriant garden of widow's weeds, enters.
She is a lady more strongly and sharply
featured than her sister, but there is nothing
thin-lipped about her; with resolute
eye and mouth a little grim, yet pleased at
so finding herself, she steps into this
chamber of old memories and cherished
possessions, which translation to another
and a better world has made hers again.
For a moment she sees the desire of her
eyes and is satisfied; but for a moment
only. The apparition of another already
in possession takes her aback.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>with soft effusiveness</i>). Well, Laura!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>startled</i>). Julia!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> <i>Here</i> you are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Whoever thought of finding you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>sweetly</i>). Didn't you?</p>

<p>(<i>They have managed to embrace: but Laura
continues to have her grievance.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[<a href="./images/16.png">16</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> No! not for a moment. I really think
they might have told me. What brought you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Our old home, Laura. It was a natural
choice, I think: as one was allowed to choose. I
suppose you were?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>her character showing</i>). I didn't ask anyone's
leave to come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> And how are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> I don't know; I want my tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Hannah is just bringing it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Who's Hannah?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> <i>Our</i> Hannah: our old servant. Didn't
<i>she</i> open the door to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> What? Come back, has she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I found her here when I came, seven years
ago. I didn't ask questions. Here she is.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Enter</span> <i>Hannah with the tea-tray</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>with a sort of grim jocosity</i>). How d'ye do,
Hannah?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hannah.</span> Nicely, thank you, Ma'am. How are you,
Ma'am?</p>

<p>(<i>Hannah, as she puts down the tray, is prepared
to have her hand shaken: for it is a long
time (thirty years or so in earthly
measure) since they met. But Mrs.
James is not so cordial as all that.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[<a href="./images/17.png">17</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> I'm very tired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> You've come a long way.</p>

<p>(<i>But Laura's sharp attention has gone elsewhere.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Hannah, what have you got my best tray
for? You know that is not to be used every day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> It's all right, Laura. You don't understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> What don't I understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Here one always uses the best. Nothing
wears out or gets broken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Then where's the pleasure of it? If one
always uses them and they never break&mdash;'best'
means nothing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> It is a little puzzling at first. You must
be patient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> I'm not a child, Julia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>beautifully ignoring</i>). A little more coal,
please, Hannah. (<i>Then to her sister as she pours out
the tea.</i>) And how did you leave everybody?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Oh, pretty much as usual. Most of them
having colds. That's how I got mine. Mrs. Hilliard
came to call and left it behind her. I went out with
it in an east wind and that finished me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Oh, but how provoking! (<i>She wishes to
be sympathetic; but this is a line of conversation she
instinctively avoids.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[<a href="./images/18.png">18</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> <i>No</i>, Julia! . . . (<i>This, delivered with force,
arrests the criminal intention.</i>) <i>No</i> sugar. To think
of your forgetting that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>most sweetly</i>). Milk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Yes, you know I take milk.</p>

<p>(<i>Crossing over, but sitting away from the tea-table,
she lets her sister wait on her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Did Martha send me any message?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> How could she? She didn't know I was
coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Was it so sudden?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> I sent for her and she didn't come. Think
of that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Oh! She would be sorry. Tea-cake?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>taking the tea-cake that is offered her</i>). I'm
not so sure. She was nursing Edwin's boy through
the measles, so of course <i>I</i> didn't count. (<i>Nosing
suspiciously.</i>) Is this China tea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> If you like to think it. You have as you
choose. How is our brother, Edwin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> His wife's more trying than ever. Julia,
what a fool that woman is!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Well, let's hope he doesn't know it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> He must know. I've told him. She sent
a wreath to my funeral, 'With love and fond affection,
from Emily.' Fond fiddlesticks! Humbug! She
knows I can't abide her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[<a href="./images/19.png">19</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I suppose she thought it was the correct
thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> And I doubt if it cost more than ten shillings.
Now Mrs. Dobson&mdash;you remember her: she
lives in Tudor Street with a daughter one never sees&mdash;something
wrong in her head, and has fits&mdash;she sent
me a cross of lilies, white lilac, and stephanotis,
as handsome as you could wish; and a card&mdash;I
forget what was on the card. . . . Julia, when you
died&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Oh, don't Laura!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Well, you did die, didn't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Here one doesn't talk of it. That's over.
There are things you will have to learn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> What I was going to say was&mdash;when I
died I found my sight was much better. I could read
all the cards without my glasses. Do <i>you</i> use glasses?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Sometimes, for association. I have these
of our dear Mother's in her tortoise-shell case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> That reminds me. Where is our Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> She comes&mdash;sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Why isn't she here always?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>with pained sweetness</i>). I don't know,
Laura. I never ask questions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Really, Julia, I shall be afraid to open my
mouth presently!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>long-suffering still</i>). When you see her you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[<a href="./images/20.png">20</a>]</span>
will understand. I told her you were coming, so I
daresay she will look in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> 'Look in'!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Perhaps. That is her chair, you remember.
She always sits there, still.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Enter</span> <i>Hannah with the coal</i>.)</p>

<p>Just a little on, please, Hannah&mdash;only a little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> This isn't China tea: it's Indian, three
and sixpenny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Mine is ten shilling China.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Lor', Julia! How are you able to afford
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> A little imagination goes a long way here,
you'll find. Once I tasted it. So now I can always
taste it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Well! I wish I'd known.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Now you <i>do</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> But I never tasted tea at more than three-and-six.
Had I known, I could have got two ounces
of the very best, and had it when&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> A lost opportunity. Life is full of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Then you mean to tell me that if I had
indulged more then, I could indulge more now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Undoubtedly. As I never knew what it
was to wear sables, I have to be content with
ermine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[<a href="./images/21.png">21</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Lor', Julia, how paltry!</p>

<p>(<i>While this conversation has been going on,
a gentle old lady has appeared upon the
scene, unnoticed and unannounced. One
perceives, that is to say, that the high-backed
arm-chair beside the fire, sheltered
by a screen from all possibility of draughts,
has an occupant. Dress and appearance
show a doubly septuagenarian character:
at the age of seventy, which in this place
she retains as the hall-mark of her earthly
pilgrimage, she belongs also to the 'seventies'
of the last century, wears watered
silk, and retains under her cap a shortened
and stiffer version of the side-curls with
which she and all 'the sex' captivated the
hearts of Charles Dickens and other
novelists in their early youth. She has
soft and indeterminate features, and when
she speaks her voice, a little shaken by
the quaver of age, is soft and indeterminate
also. Gentle and lovable, you
will be surprised to discover that she, also,
has a will of her own; but for the present
this does not show. From the dimly
illumined corner behind the lamp her voice
comes soothingly to break the discussion.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;old lady.</span> My dear, would you move the light a
little nearer? I've dropped a stitch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[<a href="./images/22.png">22</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>starting up</i>). Why, Mother dear, when did
you come in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>interposing with arresting hand</i>). Don't!
You mustn't try to touch her, or she goes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Goes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I can't explain. She is not quite herself.
She doesn't always hear what one says.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>assertively</i>). She can hear me. (<i>To prove
it, she raises her voice defiantly.</i>) Can't you, Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;mrs. r.</span> (<i>the voice perhaps reminding her</i>). Jane,
dear, I wonder what's become of Laura, little Laura:
she was always so naughty and difficult to manage,
so different from Martha&mdash;and the rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Lor', Julia! Is it as bad as that?
Mother, 'little Laura' is here, sitting in front of you.
Don't you know me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;mrs. r.</span> Do you remember, Jane, one day when
we'd all started for a walk, Laura had forgotten to
bring her gloves, and I sent her back for them? And
on the way she met little Dorothy Jones, and she
took her gloves off her, and came back with them just
as if they were her own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> What a good memory you have, Mother!
I remember it too. She was an odious little thing,
that Dorothy&mdash;always so whiney-piney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> More tea, Laura?</p>

<p>(<i>Laura pushes her cup at her without remark,</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[<a href="./images/23.png">23</a>]</span>
<i>for she has been kept waiting; then, in loud
tones, to suit the one whom she presumes
to be rather deaf:</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Mother! Where are you living now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;mrs. r.</span> I'm living, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> I said 'where?'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> We live where it suits us, Laura.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Julia, I wasn't addressing myself to you.
Mother, where <i>are</i> you living? . . . Why, <i>where</i> has
she gone to?</p>

<p>(<i>For now we perceive that this gentle Old Lady
so devious in her conversation has a power
of self-possession, of which, very retiringly,
she avails herself.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>improving the occasion, as she hands back the
cup, with that touch of superiority so exasperating to a
near relative</i>). Now you see! If you press her too
much, she goes. . . . You'll have to accommodate
yourself, Laura.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>imposing her own explanation</i>). I think
you gave me <i>green</i> tea, Julia . . . or have had it
yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>knowing better</i>). The dear Mother seldom
stays long, except when she finds me alone.</p>

<p>(<i>Having insinuated this barb into the flesh of
her 'dear sister,' she takes up her crochet
with an air of great contentment. Mrs.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[<a href="./images/24.png">24</a>]</span>
<i>James, meanwhile, to make herself more
at home, now that tea is finished, undoes
her bonnet-strings with a tug, and lets
them hang. She is not in the best of
tempers.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> I don't believe she recognised me. Why
did she keep on calling me 'Jane'?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> She took you for poor Aunt Jane, I fancy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>infuriated at being taken for anyone 'poor'</i>).
Why should she do that, pray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Well, there always was a likeness, you
know; and you are older than you were, Laura.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>crushingly</i>). Does 'poor Aunt Jane' wear
widow's weeds? (<i>This reminds her not only of her own
condition, but of other things as well. She sits up and
takes a stiller bigger bite into her new world.</i>) Julia! . . .
Where's William?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I haven't inquired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>self-importance and a sense of duty consuming
her</i>). I wish to see him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Better not, as it didn't occur to you before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Am I not to see my own husband,
pray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> He didn't ever live <i>here</i>, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> He can come, I suppose. He has got legs
like the rest of us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Yes, but one can't force people: at least,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[<a href="./images/25.png">25</a>]</span>
not here. You should remember that&mdash;before he
married you&mdash;he had other ties.</p>

<p>(<i>Mrs. James preserves her self-possession,
but there is battle in her eye.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> He was married to me longer than he was
to Isabel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> They had children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> I could have had children if I chose. I
didn't choose. . . . Julia, how am I to see him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>washing her hands of it</i>). You must manage
for yourself, Laura.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> I'm puzzled! Here are we in the next
world just as we expected, and where are all the&mdash;? I
mean, oughtn't we to be seeing a great many more
things than we do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> What sort of things?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Well, . . . have you seen Moses and the
Prophets?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I haven't looked for them, Laura. On
Sundays, I still go to hear Mr. Moore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> That's you all over! You never would go
to the celebrated preachers. But I mean to. (<i>Pious
curiosity awakens.</i>) What happens here, on Sundays?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Oh, just the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> No <i>High</i> Church ways, I hope? If they
go in for that here, I shall go out!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[<a href="./images/26.png">26</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>patiently explanatory</i>). You will go out if
you wish to go out. You can choose your church.
As I tell you, I always go to hear Mr. Moore; you can
go and hear Canon Farrar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Dean Farrar, I <i>suppose</i> you mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> He was not Dean in my day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> He ought to have been a Bishop&mdash;<i>Arch</i>bishop,
<i>I</i> think&mdash;so learned, and such a magnificent
preacher. But I still wonder why we don't see Moses
and the Prophets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Well, Laura, it's the world as we knew it&mdash;that
for the present. No doubt other things will
come in time, gradually. But I don't know: I don't
ask questions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>doubtfully</i>). I suppose it <i>is</i> Heaven, in a
way, though?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Dispensation has its own ways, Laura;
and we have ours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>who is not going to be theologically dictated
to by anyone lower than Dean Farrar</i>). Julia, I shall
start washing the old china again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> As you like; nothing ever gets soiled
here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> It's all very puzzling. The world seems
cut in half. Things don't seem <i>real</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> <i>More</i> real, I should say. We have them&mdash;as
we wish them to be.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[<a href="./images/27.png">27</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Then why can't we have our Mother,
like other things?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Ah, with persons it is different. We all
belong to ourselves now. That one has to accept.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>stubbornly</i>). Does William belong to <i>him</i>self?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> It isn't Scriptural!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> It's better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Julia, don't be blasphemous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> To consult William's wishes, I meant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> But I want him. I've a right to him.
If he didn't mean to belong to me, he ought not to
have married me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> People make mistakes sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Then they should stick to them. It's not
honourable. Julia, I mean to have William!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>resignedly</i>). You and he must arrange that
between you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>making a dash for it</i>). William! William,
I say! William!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Oh, Laura, you'll wake the dead! (<i>She
gasps, but it is too late: the hated word is out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>as one who will be obeyed</i>). William!</p>

<p>(<i>The door does not open; but there appears
through it the indistinct figure of an</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[<a href="./images/28.png">28</a>]</span>
<i>elderly gentleman with a weak chin and
a shifting eye. He stands irresolute and
apprehensive; clearly his presence there
is perfunctory. Wearing his hat and
carrying a hand-bag, he seems merely to
have looked in while passing.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Apparently you are to have your wish.
(<i>She waves an introductory hand; Mrs. James turns,
and regards the unsatisfactory apparition with suspicion.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> William, is that you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william</span> (<i>nervously</i>). Yes, my dear; it's me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Can't you be more distinct than that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> Why do you want me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Have you forgotten I'm your wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> I thought you were my widow, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> William, don't prevaricate. I am your
wife, and you know it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> Does a wife wear widow's weeds? A
widow is such a distant relation: no wonder I look
indistinct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> How did I know whether I was going to
find you here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> Where else? But you look very nice
as you are, my dear. Black suits you.</p>

<p>(<i>But Mrs. James is not to be turned off by
compliments.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[<a href="./images/29.png">29</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> William, who are you living with?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> With myself, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Anyone else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> Off and on I have friends staying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Are you living with Isabel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> She comes in occasionally to see how
I'm getting on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> And how are you 'getting on'&mdash;without
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> Oh, I manage&mdash;somehow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Are you living a proper life, William?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> Well, I'm <i>here</i>, my dear; what more do
you want to know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> There's a great deal I want to know. But
I wish you'd come in and shut the door, instead of
standing out there in the passage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> The door <i>is</i> shut, Laura.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Then I don't call it a door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william</span> (<i>trying to make things pleasant</i>). When is
a door not a door? When it's a parent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> William, I want to talk seriously. Do you
know that when you died you left a lot of debts I
didn't know about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> I didn't know about them either, my
dear. But if you had, it wouldn't have made any
difference.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[<a href="./images/30.png">30</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Yes, it would! I gave you a very expensive
funeral.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> That was to please yourself, my dear;
it didn't concern me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Have you no self-respect? I've been at
my own funeral to-day, let me tell you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> Have you, my dear? Rather trying,
wasn't that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Yes, it was. They've gone and put me
beside you; and now I begin to wish they hadn't!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> Go and haunt them for it!</p>

<p>(<i>At this Julia deigns a slight chuckle.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>abruptly getting back to her own</i>). I had to
go into a smaller house, William. And people knew
it was because you'd left me badly off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> That reflected on me, my dear, not on
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> It reflected on me for ever having married
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> I've often heard you blame yourself.
Well, now you're free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> I'm <i>not</i> free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> You can be if you like. Hadn't you
better?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>sentimentally</i>). Don't you see I'm still in
mourning for you, William?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[<a href="./images/31.png">31</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> I appreciate the compliment, my dear.
Don't spoil it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Don't be heartless!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> I'm not: far from it. (<i>He looks at his
watch.</i>) I'm afraid I must go now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Why must you go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> They are expecting me&mdash;to dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Who's 'they'?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;william.</span> The children and their mother. They've
invited me to stay the night.</p>

<p>(<i>Mrs. James does her best to conceal the shock
this gives her. She delivers her ultimatum
with judicial firmness.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> William, I wish you to come and live here
with me.</p>

<p>(<i>William vanishes. Mrs. James in a fervour
of virtuous indignation hastens to the
door, opens it, and calls 'William!' but
there is no answer.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Julia, meanwhile, has rung the bell. Mrs.
James stills stands glowering in the door-way
when she hears footsteps, and moves
majestically aside for the returned penitent
to enter; but alas! it is only Hannah,
obedient to the summons of the bell. Mrs.
James faces round and fires a shot at her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Hannah, you <i>are</i> an ugly woman.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[<a href="./images/32.png">32</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>faint with horror</i>). Laura!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hannah</span> (<i>imperturbably</i>). Well, Ma'am, I'm as God
made me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Yes, please, take the tea-things. (<i>Sotto
voce, as Hannah approaches.</i>) I'm sorry, Hannah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hannah.</span> It doesn't matter, Ma'am. (<i>She picks up
the tray expeditiously and carries it off.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Mrs. James eyes the departing tray, and is
again reminded of something.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Julia, where is the silver tea-pot?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Which, Laura?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Why, that beautiful one of our Mother's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> When we shared our dear Mother's things
between us, didn't Martha have it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Yes, she did. But she tells me she doesn't
know what's become of it. When I ask, what did
she do with it in the first place? she loses her
temper. But once she told me she left it here with
<i>you</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>The fierce eye and the accusing tone make
no impression on that cushioned fortress
of gentility. With suave dignity Miss
Robinson makes chaste denial.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>insistent</i>). Yes; in a box.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> In a box? Oh, she may have left anything
in a box.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[<a href="./images/33.png">33</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> It was that box she always travelled
about with and never opened. Well, I looked in it
once (never mind how), and the tea-pot wasn't
there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>gently, making allowance</i>). Well, I <i>didn't</i>
look in it, Laura.</p>

<p>(<i>Like a water-lily folding its petals she adjusts
a small shawl about her shoulders, and
sinks composedly into her chair.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> The more fool you! . . . But all the other
things she had of our Mother's <i>were</i> there: a perfect
magpie's nest! And she, living in her boxes, and
never settling anywhere. What did she want with
them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I can't say, Laura.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> No&mdash;no more can I; no more can anyone!
Martha has got the miser spirit. She's as grasping
as a caterpillar. <i>I</i> ought to have had that tea-pot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Because I had a house of my own, and
people coming to tea. Martha never had anyone to
tea with her in her life&mdash;except in lodgings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> We all like to live in our own way. Martha
liked going about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Yes. She promised <i>me</i>, after William&mdash;I
suppose I had better say 'evaporated' as you won't
let me say 'died'&mdash;she promised always to stay with
me for three months in the year. She never did.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[<a href="./images/34.png">34</a>]</span>
Two, and some little bits, were the most. And I want
to know where was that tea-pot all the time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>a little jocosely</i>). Not in the box, apparently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>returning to her accusation</i>). I thought you
had it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> You were mistaken. Had I had it here,
you would have found it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Did Martha never tell <i>you</i> what she did
with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I never asked, Laura.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Julia, if you say that again I shall
scream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Won't you take your things off?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Presently. When I feel more at home.
(<i>Returning to the charge.</i>) But most of our Mother's
things are here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Your share and mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> How did you get mine here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> You brought them. At least, they <i>came</i>,
a little before you did. Then I knew you were on
your way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>impressed</i>). Lor'! So that's how things
happen?</p>

<p>(<i>She goes and begins to take a look round, and
Julia takes up her crochet again. As she
does so her eye is arrested by a little
old-fashioned hour-glass standing upon</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[<a href="./images/35.png">35</a>]</span>
<i>the table from which the tea-tray has been
taken, the sands of which are still running.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>softly, almost to herself</i>). Oh, but how
strange! That was Martha's. Is Martha coming
too? (<i>She picks up the glass, looks at it, and sets
it down again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>who is examining the china on a side-table</i>).
Why, I declare, Julia! Here is your Dresden that was
broken&mdash;without a crack in it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> No, Laura, it was yours that was broken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> It was <i>not</i> mine; it was yours. . . .
Don't you remember <i>I</i> broke it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> When you broke it you said it was mine.
Until you broke it, you said it was yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Very well, then: as you wish. It isn't
broken now, and it's mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> That's satisfactory. I get my own back
again. It's the better one.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Enter</span> <i>Hannah with a telegram on a salver</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hannah</span> (<i>in a low voice of mystery</i>). A telegram,
Ma'am.</p>

<p>(<i>Julia opens it. The contents evidently
startle her, but she retains her presence
of mind.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> No answer.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Exit</span> <i>Hannah</i>.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[<a href="./images/36.png">36</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Laura, Martha is coming!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Here? Well, I wonder how she has
managed that!</p>

<p>(<i>Her sister hands her the telegram, which she
reads.</i>)</p>

<p>'Accident. Quite safe. Arriving by the 6.30.'
Why, it's after that now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>sentimentally</i>). Oh, Laura, only think!
So now we shall be all together again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Yes, I suppose we shall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> It will be quite like old days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>warningly, as she sits down again and prepares
for narrative</i>). Not <i>quite</i>, Julia. (<i>She leans
forward, and speaks with measured emphasis.</i>)
Martha's temper has got very queer! She never had
a very good temper, as you know: and it's grown
on her.</p>

<p>(<i>A pause. Julia remains silent.</i>)</p>

<p>I could tell you some things; but&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Seeing herself
unencouraged</i>) oh, you'll find out soon enough!
(<i>Then, to stand right with herself</i>) Julia, <i>am</i> I difficult
to get on with?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Oh well, we all have our little ways,
Laura.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> But Martha: she's so rude! I can't
introduce her to people! If anyone comes, she just
runs away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[<a href="./images/37.png">37</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>changing the subject</i>). D'you remember,
Laura, that charming young girl we met at Mrs.
Somervale's, the summer Uncle Fletcher stayed with
us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>snubbingly</i>). I can't say I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I met her the other day: married, and
with three children&mdash;and just as pretty and young-looking
as ever.</p>

<p>(<i>All this is said with the most ravishing air,
but Laura is not to be diverted.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Ah! I daresay. When Martha behaves
like that, I hold my tongue and say nothing. But
what people must think, I don't know. Julia, when
you first came here, did you find old friends and
acquaintances? Did anybody recognise you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> A few called on me: nobody I didn't wish
to see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Is that odious man who used to be our
next-door neighbour&mdash;the one who played on the
'cello&mdash;here still?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Mr. Harper? I see him occasionally. I
don't find him odious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> <i>Don't you?</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> It was his wife who was the&mdash;&mdash; She isn't
here: and I don't think he wants her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Where is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I didn't ask, Laura.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[<a href="./images/38.png">38</a>]</span>
(<i>Mrs. James gives a jerk of exasperation, but
at that moment the bell rings and a low
knock is heard.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>ecstatically</i>). Here she is!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Julia, I wonder how it is Martha survived
us. She's much the oldest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>pleasantly palpitating</i>). Does it matter?
Does it matter?</p>

<p>(<i>The door opens and in comes Martha. She
has neither the distinction of look nor the
force of character which belongs to her two
sisters. Age has given a depression to
the plain kindliness of her face, and there
is a harassed look about her eyes. She
peeps into the room a little anxiously,
then enters, carrying a large flat box
covered in purple paper which, in her
further progress across the room she lays
upon the table. She talks in short jerks
and has a quick, hurried way of doing
things, as if she liked to get through and
have done with them. It is the same
when she submits herself to the embrace
of her relations.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Oh, so you've come at last. Quite time, too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Yes, here I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> My dear Martha, welcome to your old
home! (<i>Embracing her.</i>) How are you?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[<a href="./images/39.png">39</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I'm cold. Well, Laura.</p>

<p>(<i>Between these two the embrace is less cordial,
but it takes place.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> How did you come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>seeing harassment in her sister's eye</i>). Arrived
safely, at any rate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I think I was in a railway accident, but
I can't be sure. I only heard the crash and people
shouting. I didn't wait to see. I just put my fingers
in my ears, and ran away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Why do you think it was a railway accident?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Because I was in a railway carriage. I
was coming to your funeral. If you'd told me
you were ill I'd have come before. I was bringing
you a wreath. And then, as I tell you, there
was a crash and a shout; and that's all I know
about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Lor', Martha! I suppose they'll have
an inquest on you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha</span> (<i>stung</i>). I think they'd better mind their
own business, and you mind yours!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Laura! Here we don't talk about such
things. They don't concern us. Would you like
tea, Martha, or will you wait for supper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha</span> (<i>who has shaken her head at the offer of tea,</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[<a href="./images/40.png">40</a>]</span>
<i>and nodded a preference for supper</i>). You know how
I've always dreaded death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Oh, don't, my dear Martha! It's past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Yes; but it's upset me. The relief,
that's what I can't get over: the relief!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Presently you will be more used to it.</p>

<p>(<i>She helps her off with her cloak.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> There were people sitting to right and to
left of me and opposite; and suddenly a sort of crash
of darkness seemed to come all over me, and I saw
nothing more. I didn't feel anything: only a sort of
a jar here.</p>

<p>(<i>She indicates the back of her neck. Julia
finds these anatomical details painful,
and holds her hands deprecatingly; but
Laura has no such qualms. She is now
undoing the parcel which, she considers,
is hers.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> I daresay it was only somebody's box
from the luggage-rack. I've known that happen.
I don't suppose for a minute that it was a railway
accident.</p>

<p>(<i>She unfurls the tissue paper of the box and
takes out the wreath.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Why talk about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Anyway, nothing has happened to these.
'With fondest love from Martha.' H'm. Pretty!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[<a href="./images/41.png">41</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Martha, would you like to go upstairs
with your things? And you, Laura?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I will presently, when I've got warm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Not yet. Martha, why was I put into
that odious shaped coffin? More like a canoe than
anything. I said it was to be straight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I'd nothing to do with it, Laura. I
wasn't there. You know I wasn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> If you'd come when I asked you, you could
have seen to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> You didn't tell me you were dying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Do people tell each other when they are
dying? They don't <i>know</i>. I told you I wasn't well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> You always told me that, just when I'd
settled down somewhere else. . . . Of course I'd
have come if I'd known! (<i>testily</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Oh, surely we needn't go into these matters
now! Isn't it better to accept things?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> I like to have my wishes attended to.
What was going to be done about the furniture?
(<i>This to Martha.</i>) You know, I suppose, that I left
it to the two of you&mdash;you and Edwin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> We were going to give it to Bella, to set
up house with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> <i>That's</i> not what I intended. I meant you
to keep on the house and live there. Why couldn't
you?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[<a href="./images/42.png">42</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha</span> (<i>with growing annoyance</i>). Well, <i>that's</i>
settled now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> It wasn't for Arabella. Arabella was
never a favourite of mine. Why should Arabella
have my furniture?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Well, you'd better send word, and have
it stored up for you till doomsday! Edwin doesn't
want it; he's got enough of his own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>in a sleek, injured voice</i>). Julia, I'm going
upstairs to take my things off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Very well, Laura.</p>

<p>(<i>And Laura makes her injured exit.</i>)</p>

<p>So you've been with Edwin, and his family?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Yes. I'm never well there; but I
wanted the change.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> You mean, you had been staying with
Laura?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I always go and stay with her, as long as
I can&mdash;three months, I'm supposed to. But this
year&mdash;well, I couldn't manage with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Is she so much more difficult than she used
to be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Of course, I don't know what she's like
here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Oh, she has been very much herself&mdash;<i>poor</i>
Laura!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I know! Julia, I know! And I try<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[<a href="./images/43.png">43</a>]</span>
to make allowances. All her life she's had her own
way with somebody. Poor William! Of course I
know he had his faults. But he used to come and
say to me: 'Martha, I <i>can't</i> please her.' Well, poor
man, he's at peace now, let's hope! Oh, Julia, I've
just thought: whatever will poor William do? He's
here, I suppose, somewhere?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Oh yes. He's here, Martha.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> She'll rout him out, depend on it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> She has routed him out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha</span> (<i>awe-struck</i>). Has she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>shaking her head wisely</i>). William won't
live with her; he knows better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Who will live with her, then? She's
bound to get hold of somebody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Apparently she means to live here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Then it's going to be me! I know it's
going to be me! When we lived here before, it used
to be poor Mamma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> The dear Mother is quite capable of looking
after herself, you'll find. You needn't belong to
Laura if you don't like, Martha. I never let her take
possession of <i>me</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> She seems never to want to. I don't
know how you manage it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Oh, we've had our little tussles. But here
you will find it much easier. You can vanish.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[<a href="./images/44.png">44</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I mean&mdash;vanish. It takes the place of
wings. One does it almost without knowing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> How do you do it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> You just wish yourself elsewhere; and you
come back when you like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Have <i>you</i> ever done it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>with a world of meaning</i>). Not yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> She won't like it. One doesn't belong
to one's self, when she's about&mdash;nor does anything.
I've had to hide my own things from her sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I shouldn't wonder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Do you remember the silver tea-pot?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I've been reminded of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> It was mine, wasn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Oh, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Laura never would admit it was mine.
She wanted it; so I'd no right to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I had a little idea that was it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> For years she was determined to have it:
and I was determined she shouldn't have it. And she
didn't have it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Who did have it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Henrietta <i>was</i> to. I sent it her as a
wedding-present, and told her Laura was never to
know. And, as she was in Australia, that seemed safe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[<a href="./images/45.png">45</a>]</span>
Well, the ship it went out in was wrecked&mdash;all because
of that tea-pot, I believe! So now it's at the bottom
of the sea!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Destiny!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> She searched my boxes to try and find it:
stole my keys! I missed them, but I didn't dare say
anything. I used to wrap it in my night-gown and
hide it in the bed during the day, and sleep with it
under my pillow at night. And I was so thankful
when Henrietta got married; so as to be rid of it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Hush!</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Re-enter</span> <i>Mrs. James, her bonnet still on,
with the strings dangling, and her cloak
on her arm</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Julia I've been looking at your room in
there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>coldly</i>). Have you, Laura?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> It used to be our Mother's room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I don't need to be reminded of that: it is
why I chose it. (<i>Rising gracefully from her chair, she
goes to attend to the fire.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Don't you think it would be much better
for you to give it up, and let our Mother come back
and live with us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> She has never expressed the wish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Of course not, with you in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> She was not in it when I came.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[<a href="./images/46.png">46</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> How could you expect it, in a house all
by herself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I gave her the chance: I began by occupying
my own room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>self-caressingly</i>). <i>I</i> wasn't here then.
That didn't occur to you, I suppose? You seem to
forget you weren't the only one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Kind of you to remind me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Saucy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Martha, will you excuse me?</p>

<p>(<i>Polite to the last, she vanishes gracefully away
from the vicinity of the coal-box. The
place where she has been stooping knows
her no more.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>rushing round the intervening table to investigate</i>).
Julia!</p>

<p>(<i>Martha is quite as much surprised as Mrs.
James, but less indignant.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Well! Did you ever?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>facing about after vain search</i>). Does she
think that is the proper way to behave to <i>me</i>?
Julia!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> It's no good, Laura. You know Julia, as
well as I do. If she makes up her mind to a thing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Yes. She's been waiting here to exercise
her patience on me, and now she's happy! Well,
she'll have to learn that this house doesn't belong to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[<a href="./images/47.png">47</a>]</span>
<i>her</i> any longer. She has got to accommodate herself
to living with others. . . . I wonder how she'd like
me to go and sit in that pet chair of hers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>softly reappearing in the chair which the
'dear Mother' usually occupies</i>). You can go and
sit in it if you wish, Laura.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>ignoring her return</i>). Martha, do you
remember that odious man who used to live next door,
who played the 'cello on Sundays?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Oh yes, I remember. They used to
hang out washing in the garden, didn't they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>very scandalously</i>). Julia is friends with
him! They call on each other. His wife doesn't
live with him any longer.</p>

<p>(<i>Julia rises and goes slowly and majestically
out of the room.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>after relishing what she conceives to be her
rout of the enemy</i>). Martha, what do you think of
Julia?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Oh, she's&mdash;&mdash; What do you want me
to think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> High and mighty as ever, isn't she?
She's been here by herself so long she thinks the whole
place is hers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I daresay we shall settle down well
enough presently. Which room are you sleeping
in?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[<a href="./images/48.png">48</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Of course, I have my old one. Where do
you want to go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> The green room will suit me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> And Julia means to keep our Mother's
room: I can see that. No wonder she won't come
and stay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Have you seen her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> She just 'looked in,' as Julia calls it. I
could see she'd hoped to find me alone. Julia always
thought <i>she</i> was the favourite. I knew better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> How was she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Just her old self; but as if she missed
something. It wasn't a <i>happy</i> face, until I spoke to
her: then it all brightened up. . . . Oh, thank you
for the wreath, Martha. Where did you get it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Emily made it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> That fool! Then she made her own too,
I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Yes. That went the day before, so you
got it in time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> I thought it didn't look up to much.
(<i>She is now contemplating Emily's second effort with
a critical eye.</i>) Now a little maiden-hair fern would
have made a world of difference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I don't hold with flowers myself. I
think it's wasteful. But, of course, one has to
do it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[<a href="./images/49.png">49</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>with pained regret</i>). I'm sorry, Martha; I
return it&mdash;with many thanks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> What's the good of that? I can't give
it back to Emily, now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>with quiet grief</i>). I don't wish to be a cause
of waste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Well, take it to pieces, then; and put
them in water&mdash;or wear it round your head!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Ten beautiful wreaths my friends sent me.
They are all lying on my grave now! A pity that
love is so wasteful! Well, I suppose I must go
now and change into my cap. (<i>Goes to the door, where
she encounters Julia.</i>) Why, Julia, you nearly knocked
me down!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>ironically</i>). I beg your pardon, Laura; it
comes of using the same door. Hannah has lighted a
fire in your room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> That's sensible at any rate.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Exit</span> <i>Mrs. James</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Well? And how do you find Laura?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Julia, I don't know whether I can stand
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> She hasn't got quite&mdash;used to herself yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha</span> (<i>explosively</i>). Put that away somewhere!</p>

<p>(<i>She gives an angry shove to the wreath.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Put it away! Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha</span> (<i>furiously</i>). Emily made it: and it didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[<a href="./images/50.png">50</a>]</span>
cost anything; and it hasn't got any maiden-hair
fern in it; and it's too big to wear with her cap. So
it's good for nothing! Put it on the fire! She doesn't
want to see it again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>comprehending the situation, restores the wreath
to its box</i>). Why did you bring it here, Martha?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha</span> (<i>miserably</i>). I don't know. I just clung
on to it. I suppose it was on my mind to look after
it, and see it wasn't damaged. So I found I'd brought
it with me. . . . I believe, now I think of it, I've
brought some sandwiches, too. (<i>She routs in a small
hand-bag.</i>) Yes, I have. Well, I can have them for
supper. . . . Emily made those too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Then I think you'd better let Hannah
have them&mdash;for the sake of peace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha</span> (<i>woefully</i>). I thought I <i>was</i> going to have
peace here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> It will be all right, Martha&mdash;presently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Well, I don't want to be uncharitable;
but I do wish&mdash;I must say it&mdash;I do wish Laura had
been cremated.</p>

<p>(<i>This is the nearest she can do for wishing
her sister in the place to which she thinks
she belongs. But the uncremated Mrs.
James now re-enters in widow's cap.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Julia, have you ever seen Papa, since you
came here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>frigidly</i>). No, I have not.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[<a href="./images/51.png">51</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Has our Mother seen him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I haven't&mdash;&mdash; (<i>About to say the forbidden
thing, she checks herself.</i>) Mamma has <i>not</i> seen him:
nor does she know his whereabouts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Does nobody know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Nobody that I know of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Well, but he must be somewhere. Is
there no way of finding him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Perhaps you can devise one. I suppose,
if we chose, we could go to him; but I'm not sure&mdash;as
he doesn't come to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Lor', Julia! Suppose he should be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>deprecatingly</i>). Oh, Laura!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> But, Julia, it's very awkward, not to
know where one's own father is. Don't people ever
ask?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Never, I'm thankful to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Perhaps <i>they</i> know better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>after a pause</i>). I'm afraid he didn't lead
a good life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Oh, why can't you let the thing be?
If you don't remember him, I do. I was fond of him.
He was always very kind to us as children; and if he
did run away with the governess it was a good riddance&mdash;so
far as she was concerned. We hated
her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[<a href="./images/52.png">52</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> I wonder whether they are together still.
You haven't inquired after <i>her</i>, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>luxuriating in her weariness</i>). I&mdash;have&mdash;<i>not</i>,
Laura!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Don't you think it's our solemn duty to
inquire? I shall ask our Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I hope you will do nothing of the sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> But we ought to know: otherwise we
don't know how to think of him, whether with mercy
and pardon for his sins, or with reprobation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha</span> (<i>angrily</i>). Why need you think? Why
can't you leave him alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> An immortal soul, Martha. It's no good
leaving him alone: that won't alter facts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I don't think this is quite a nice subject for
discussion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Nice? Was it ever intended to be nice?
Eternal punishment wasn't provided as a consolation
prize for anybody, so far as I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I think it's very horrible&mdash;for us to be
sitting here&mdash;by the fire, and&mdash; (<i>But theology is not
Martha's strong point</i>). Oh! why can't you leave it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Because it's got to be faced; and I mean
to face it. Now, Martha, don't try to get out of it.
We have got to find our Father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I think, before doing anything, we ought
to consult Mamma.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[<a href="./images/53.png">53</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Very well; call her and consult her! You
were against it just now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I am against it still. It's all so unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Lor', there <i>is</i> Mamma!</p>

<p>(<i>Old Mrs. Robinson is once more in her place
Martha makes a move toward her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Don't, Martha. She doesn't like to be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;mrs. r.</span> I've heard what you've been talking about.
No, I haven't seen him. I've tried to get him to
come to me, but he didn't seem to want. Martha,
my dear, how are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Oh, I'm&mdash;much as usual. And you,
Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;mrs. r.</span> Well, what about your Father? Who
wants him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> I want him, Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;mrs. r.</span> What for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> First we want to know what sort of a life
he is leading. Then we want to ask him about his will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Oh, Laura!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> <i>I</i> don't. I don't care if he made a dozen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> So I thought if we all <i>called</i> him. <i>You</i>
heard when I called, didn't you? Oh no, that was
William.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;mrs. r.</span> Who's William?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Didn't you know I was married?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[<a href="./images/54.png">54</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;mrs. r.</span> No. Did he die?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Well, now, couldn't we call him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;mrs. r.</span> I daresay. He won't like it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> He must. He belongs to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;mrs. r.</span> Yes, I suppose&mdash;as I wouldn't divorce him,
though he wanted me to. I said marriages were made
in Heaven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a voice.</span> Luckily, they don't last there.</p>

<p>(<i>Greatly startled, they look around, and perceive
presently in the mirror over the mantelpiece
the apparition of a figure which
they seem dimly to recognise. A tall,
florid gentleman of the Dundreary type,
with long side-whiskers, and dressed in
the fashion of sixty years ago, has taken
up his position to one side of the ormolu
clock; standing, eye-glass in eye, with
folded arms resting on the mantel-slab
and a stylish hat in one hand, he gazes
upon the assembled family with quizzical
benevolence.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;mrs. r.</span> (<i>placidly</i>). What, is that you, Thomas?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas</span> (<i>with the fashionable lisp of the fifties, always
substituting 'th' for 's'</i>). How do you do, Susan?</p>

<p>(<i>There follows a pause, broken courageously
by Mrs. James.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Are <i>you</i> my Father?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[<a href="./images/55.png">55</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> I don't know. Who are <i>you</i>? Who are
all of you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Perhaps I had better explain. This is
our dear Mother: her you recognise. You are her
husband; we are your daughters. This is Martha,
this is Julia, and I'm Laura.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> Is this true, Susan? Are these our
progeny?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;mrs. r.</span> Yes&mdash;that is&mdash;yes, Thomas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> I should not have known it. They all
look so much older.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Than when you left us? Naturally!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> Than <i>me</i>, I meant. But you all seem
flourishing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Because we lived longer. Papa, when
did you die?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Oh! Laura!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> I don't know, child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Don't know? How don't you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> Because in prisons, and other lunatic
asylums, one isn't allowed to know anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;mrs. r.</span> A lunatic asylum! Oh, Thomas, what
brought you there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> A damned life, Susan&mdash;with you, and
others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Oh, Laura, why did you do this?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[<a href="./images/56.png">56</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> If this goes on, I shall leave the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Where are those <i>others</i> now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> Three of them I see before me. You,
Laura, used to scream horribly. When you were
teething, I was sleepless. Your Mother insisted on
having you in the room with us. No wonder I went
elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I'm going!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> Don't, Martha! You were the quietest
of the lot. When you were two years old I even began
to like you. You were the exception.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Haven't you any affection for your old
home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> None. It was a prison. You were the
gaolers and the turnkeys. To keep my feet in the
domestic way you made me wool-work slippers, and
I had to wear them. You gave me neckties, which
I wouldn't wear. You gave me affection of a demanding
kind, which I didn't want. You gave me a
moral atmosphere which I detested. And at last
I could bear it no more, and I escaped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>deaf to instruction</i>). Papa, we wish you
and our dear Mother to come back and live with us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> Live with my grandmother! How could
I live with any of you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Where <i>are</i> you living?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> Ask no questions, and you will be told
no lies.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[<a href="./images/57.png">57</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Where is <i>she</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> Which she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> The governess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> Which governess?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> The one you went away with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> D'you want her back again? You can
have her. She'll teach you a thing or two. She did
<i>me</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Then&mdash;you have repented, Papa?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> God! why did I come here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;mrs. r.</span> Yes; why did you come? It was weak
of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> Because I never could resist women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Were you really mad when you died,
Papa?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> Yes, and am still: stark, staring, raving,
mad, like all the rest of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> I am not aware that <i>I</i> am mad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> Then you are a bad case. Not to know
it, is the worst sign of all. It's in the family: you
can't help being. Everything you say and do proves
it. . . . You were mad to come here. You are mad
to remain here. You were mad to want to see me.
I was mad to let you see me. I was mad at the mere
sight of you; and I'm mad to be off again! Goodbye,
Susan. If you send for me again, I shan't come!</p>

<p>(<i>He puts on his hat with a flourish.</i>)</p>

<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Where are you going, Father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thomas.</span> To Hell, child! Your Hell, my Heaven!</p>

<p>(<i>He spreads his arms and rises up through the
looking-glass; you see his violet frock-coat,
his check trousers, his white spats,
and patent-leather boots ascending into
and passing from view. He twiddles his

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> And now I hope you are satisfied, Laura?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Where's Mamma gone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> So you've driven her away, too. Well,
that finishes it.</p>

<p>(<i>Apparently it does. Robbed of her parental
prey, Mrs. James reverts to the next
dearest possession she is concerned about.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Martha, where is the silver tea-pot?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I don't know, Laura.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> You said Julia had it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I didn't say anything of the sort! You
said&mdash;you supposed Julia had it; and I said&mdash;suppose
she had! And I left it at that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Julia says she hasn't got it, so you <i>must</i>
have it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I haven't!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Then where is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I don't know any more than Julia knows.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[<a href="./images/59.png">59</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Then one of you is not telling the truth. . . .
(<i>Very judicially she begins to examine the two
culprits.</i>) Julia, when did you last see it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> On the day, Laura, when we shared things
between us. It became Martha's: and I never saw
it again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Martha, when did you last see it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I have not seen it&mdash;for I don't know how
long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> That is no answer to my question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha</span> (<i>vindictively</i>). Well, if you want to know,
it's at the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>deliberately</i>). Don't talk&mdash;nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> Unless a shark has eaten it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> When I ask a reasonable question, Martha,
I expect a reasonable answer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I've given you a reasonable answer!
And I wish the Judgment Day would come, and the
sea give up its dead, and then&mdash;&mdash; (<i>At the end of her
resources, the poor lady begins to gather herself up, so as
once for all to have done with it.</i>) Now, I am going downstairs
to talk to Hannah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> You will do nothing of the kind, Martha.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I'm not going to be bullied&mdash;not by you
or anyone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> I must request you to wait and hear what
I've got to say.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[<a href="./images/60.png">60</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> I don't want to hear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Julia, are we not to discuss this matter,
pray?</p>

<p>(<i>Julia, who has her eye on Martha, and is
quite enjoying this tussle of the two
says nothing.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha.</span> You and Julia can discuss it. I am going
downstairs.</p>

<p>(<i>Mrs. James crosses the room, locks the door,
and, standing mistress of all she surveys,
inquires with grim humour.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> And where are you going to be, Julia?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I am where I am, Laura. I'm not going
out of the window, or up the chimney, if that's what
you mean.</p>

<p>(<i>She continues gracefully to do her crochet.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Now, Martha, if you please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;martha</span> (<i>goaded into victory</i>). I'm sorry, Julia.
You'd better explain. I'm going downstairs.</p>

<p>(<i>Suiting the action to the word, she commits
herself doggedly to the experiment,
descending bluntly and without grace
through the carpet into the room below.
Mrs. James stands stupent.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Martha! . . . Am I to be defied in this
way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> You brought it on yourself, Laura.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[<a href="./images/61.png">61</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> You told her to do it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> She would have soon found out for herself.
(<i>Collectedly, she folds up her work and rises.</i>) And now,
I think, I will go to my room and wash my hands for
supper.</p>

<p>(<i>As she makes her stately move, her ear is
attracted by a curious metallic sound
repeated at intervals. Turning about, she
perceives, indeed they both perceive, in the
centre of the small table, a handsome silver
tea-pot which opens and shuts its lid at
them, as if trying to speak.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> Oh, look, Laura! Martha's tea-pot has
arrived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> She told a lie, then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> No, it was the truth. She wished for it.
The sea has given up its dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> Then now I <i>have</i> got it at last!</p>

<p>(<i>But, as she goes to seize the disputed possession,
Martha rises through the floor,
grabs the tea-pot, and descends to the
nether regions once more.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura</span> (<i>glaring at her sister with haggard eye</i>). Julia,
where <i>are</i> we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia.</span> I don't know what you mean, Laura.
(<i>She reaches out a polite hand.</i>) The key?</p>

<p>(<i>Mrs. James delivers up the key as one glad to
be rid of it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[<a href="./images/62.png">62</a>]</span>
<span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> What is this place we've come to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>persuasively</i>). Our home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;laura.</span> I think we are in Hell!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;julia</span> (<i>going to the door, which she unlocks with soft
triumph</i>). We are all where we wish to be, Laura.
(<i>A gong sounds.</i>) That's supper. (<i>The gong continues
its metallic bumbling.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Julia departs, leaving Mrs. James in undisputed
possession of the situation she has
made for herself.</i>)</p>
